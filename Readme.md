# WyldZig
This is WyldChess being re-written in Ziglang for further development. After being only mildly involved with the computer
chess community, I've recently been regaining my interest in it and decided it's time to rewrite my crappy 3-year old
WyldChess C codebase into something I like.

WyldZig is still under heavy development, only supporting perft for now.
